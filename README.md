# House-Prices-Prediction
The project is based on participating in the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

The challenge is to predict the final price of each home with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, using advanced gradient boosting models:

* CatBoost;
* XGBoost;
* LightGBM.

Metric: RMSE
